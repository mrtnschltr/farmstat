# FarmStat - Statistics for your favourite yield aggregators

Currently works with chrome-based browsers on
- [solfarm.io](https://solfarm.io)

The script dynamically adds additional information about your vaults.
The goal is to provide enhanced transparency about your yield farming.
Everything works within the browser, no data is being sent elsewhere.
